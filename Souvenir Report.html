<h3>Introduction</h3>
New York is one of the hot favorite destination for people of all ages all around the world. Whoever comes here would surely want a piece of it !!. The best way they 

can do that is to take back a souvenir for themselves or for their friends & relatives as a remembrance. Though we get such shops at almost all the visiting places, 

but mostly people want to shop for these in their relax timed like post dinner/drink.

<h3>Business Problem</h3>
This  study will be useful for  the audience who wants to setup a Souvenir shop in the New York neighborhood but are not fully sure which is the right place. We will 

try to find a place to setup such a shop, which is closer to parks, Coffee shops, Restaurants etc instead of buzzing places like Statue of Liberty. This will ensure 

larger prospective/genuine buyers instead of just Window Shoppers. Target Audience are all the users planning to setup a Souvenir Shop in New York City.


<h3>Data</h3>
Foursquare location data is a perfect Stop Shop providing all the needed details about the Neighborhood data. We will make API calls to Foursquare location services 

and will fetch areas closer to Parks, Restaurants etc where we can think of starting the Souvenir Shop. Will provide top 10 options so that the users can make better 

choices considering external factors like Rent, Transportation etc.
